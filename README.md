## üìù Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:
- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

[Write your reflection here]
For this project, the most difficult part was getting the video to work. I also learned that the nav bar 
should be inside the header form this project (I had previously been putting it outside of and in front of
the header tag). In the future I'll add more description to the home page, update my hobby page with new
things I've been doing, and add some projects I've done.
