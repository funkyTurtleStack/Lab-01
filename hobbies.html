        <h2>Manga/Manhwa</h2>
        <p>
            Ok, look, as much as I hate to admit it, reading bad
            mangas and manhwas is a hobby that takes up <strong>way</strong> more of
            my time than it probably should. Yes, I do read some of the
            bigger ones, but to be honest, usually I'll just pick one
            that has a stereotypically bad copy and paste name and read
            it because for some reason those are the ones that I tend to
            enjoy the most. If you ask me about a manga or manhwa you like
            though, there's a good chance I'll know it.

        <h2>Blender and Drawing</h2>
        <p>
            Recently I've been trying to get into art and 3D modelling.
            I've never really been an artist, and I'm horrible at drawing
            which is unfortunate because I've really been enjoying it lately.
            I don't have much to show for it yet, but I want to eventually be
            skilled enough to make character models for games and animations.
            Bellow is the standard donut animation I made using Blender Guru's
            tutorial video. It's not anything remarkable, but it's a start.

        <h2>Video Games / Streaming</h2>
        <p>
            Since I was a kid I've always been into video games. I'm
            sure my comment about Silksong on the home page makes that clear.
            Lately, though I haven't really put much time aside for games
            and I want to get back into it again. As an extension of that,
            I've recently started streaming myself playing games, not really for
            anybody to watch, but more so for myself as an excuse and motivation
            to get back into gaming. Below is a list of a few of my favorite
            games.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hollow Knight</li>
            <li>Slime Rancher</li>
            <li>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon</li>
            <li>Helldivers 2</li>
            <li>Bad End Theater</li>
            <li>Moonlighter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Music and Youtube</h2>
        <p>
            In my free time, usually while doing one of the other hobbies, I
            enjoy having music, a youtube video, or maybe a twitch stream playing
            in the background.
